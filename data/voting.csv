Tatte was too crowded when we planned to meet for coffee so we decided to go to bluestone lane instead and got lunch instead of just coffee. we chatted the whole time for over an hour and she is so personable and engaging. I think she would be such a great fit for theta and get along so well with members.

From the UK, she took a gap year to be a teacher in school during covid and is now a freshman on the field hockey team. With her, she was able to have a substantive conversation about more than just the harvard intro and seemed to be more passionate about things outside of just school/team.  I really appreciated her fun but relaxed personality and would love to get to chat with her more. I think she’d be a really fun addition to theta. Her experiences are really cool to hear about and she’d have fun chatting with almost anyone else in the club.  "

2/13/2022 16:48:40,juliablank@college.harvard.edu,Julia Blank,Round 2 Coffee Chats,Anna Andrews,4,,Pnm was very sweet and nice. Seems eager to join Theta to find a community on campus outside of her team (lacrosse). Very nice and sociable. Wants to study psych and excited to meet other girls on campus. It was nice that she was candid about some of her struggles with adjusting first semester and I think she’d benefit from getting a community like theta.

Could easily imagine sitting next to her at theta events. She's really passionate about field hockey and also excited about her internship this summer working for a startup. Like a lot of the girls i talked to, she's interested to find a community outside her team from theta. Something I really liked about her was that she enjoyed planning fun nights out for her friends/teammates like going into boston and think that would be a nice addition. "

Luca really opened up to me on our coffee chat about some things that she is going through, so I feel close to her. I think she is a very considerate person who cares deeply about those she loves and an amazing friend. I will ABSOLUTELY push for her if need be; I think she would be a great fit."
